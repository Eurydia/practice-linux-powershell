# Tasks

## A group

a) Create a PowerShell script which generates a Fibonacci serie ($1,1,2,3,5,8,...$) List out the first $N$ (parameter) element!
If there is no parameter, read the value from the keyboard!

b) Write a script which gets a decimal number and gives back its binary format!
E.g. $9_{10}$ = $1001_{2}$

c) Write a script which writes out the multiplication table till $10$!
$1*1, 1*2, ..., 10*10$

d) Implement a script which gets names in a file (filename as parameter, full name per
line) and list the first names which are longer than a pre-defined value (parameter)!

## B group

a) Write a PowerShell script which calculates the values of $ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d$ polinom
between $N$ and $M$ (only at integer values)!
$a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ should be read from keyboard!

b) Implement a PowerShell program which gets a roman number and gives back its
decimal value!
E.g. XI = 11

(parameters)!
Check whether $N$ is smaller than $M$ or not â€“ if not, change their values!

b) Write a script which gets a file (parameter filename) and in each line there are $4$ numbers: $3$ coordinates of a point (3D) and a radiant.
Decide line by line which points are inside a sphere!

c) Write a script which writes out a file (filename as parameter) content reverse.
